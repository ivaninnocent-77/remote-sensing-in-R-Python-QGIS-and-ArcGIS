The first research project shared here utilises Google Earth Engine's python API run in Google Collab and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery for remote sensing wildfire burn severity in Larache province in Morocco. 
The research was conducted by myself, Ivan Innocent Sekibenga at the University of Leicester in United Kingdom.
One file containns the Jupyter notebook with the code used for satellite image processing and analysis.
One file contains the html file of the image processing programming code .
One pdf file contains the manuscript authored out of the research project and produced for the MDPI Remote Sensing journal. 
The second research project is my masters dissertation entitled "Quantifying oil palm-induced deforestation and land cover change on Bugala island in Uganda using machine learning and satellite remote sensing".
